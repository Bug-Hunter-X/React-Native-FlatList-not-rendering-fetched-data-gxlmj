# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug in React Native: a `FlatList` component failing to render data even after successful fetching. The application includes error and loading states, yet the fetched data remains invisible.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` fetches data from a remote API.  Despite successful fetching, the FlatList remains empty. The error and loading states function correctly; the issue lies in rendering the actual data. This could stem from problems in data structure, data processing, or timing.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the application on your preferred React Native environment.
4. Observe the empty `FlatList` despite the loading indicator disappearing and the absence of error messages.

## Solution

The solution addresses potential issues with the data structure and ensures correct rendering within the `FlatList`.
